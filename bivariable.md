### Research Question
**Perception regarding the construction and functioning of the first and Second metro Lines of Bogota vs residents' housing characteristics**

The survey question involved `P67` vs `P82, P83, P86`

### Hypothesis:
- The more optimistic the person is, the higher the probability that they are a renter
- The more pessimistic the person is,  the higher the probability that  the person is an owner
