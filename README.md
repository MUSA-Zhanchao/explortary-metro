## Introduction & Research Questions

Bogotá, long served by an extensive bus network yet plagued by chronic congestion and air pollution, is on the cusp of a major transit transformation. The city’s first metro lines—Line 1, which will link the northwest suburbs with the city center, and Line 2, running through the northern corridor—promise not only faster, more reliable journeys but also substantial environmental and socio-economic benefits. However, the success of this infrastructure depends as much on engineering and finance as on public buy-in: how citizens perceive its effectiveness, its impact on air quality and noise, and its broader effects on livelihoods and equity.

This study examines how near subway line household perception different between Line 1 and Line 2, and how socio-economic factors influences their perception

By illuminating the perceptions held by various communities, we aim to inform both policy adjustments and communication strategies that will maximize public support and ensure that Bogotá’s metro delivers on its promise of cleaner, more equitable urban mobility.

## Method
